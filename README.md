# SwiftDataExamples

This repo contains the learning projects I used to get to grips with SwiftData.

## Getting started

The first project is an app called iTour that was created and shared by Paul Hudson as part of his excellent book 'SwiftData by example'. It is an excellent introduction to how SwiftData works and how a fairly full-featured app can be built using the default SwiftData configuration.

## iTour-v2

This copy of the iTour app is my playground for fiddling with the SwiftData configuration in order to better understand how it works.
