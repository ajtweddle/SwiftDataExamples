# SwiftDataExamples

This repo contains the projects I undertook to learn all about SwiftData and how to implement it into real world apps.

## Getting started

The first project is an app called iTour that was created and shared by Paul Hudson as part of his excellent book 'SwiftData by example'. This project provided me with an excellent introduction to how SwiftData works and how a fairly full-featured app could be built using a fairly straightforward SwiftData setup.
